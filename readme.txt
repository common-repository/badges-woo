== Description ==

Custom badges for your products, all customizable, increase your sales with visual attraction

The badges of products in WooCommerce serve to attract the attention of the visitor having great conversion power.

Using badges has been shown to have a great impact, they are also a nice way to inform the user of the status of the product, for example "TOP 1 Sales" or "New Collection".

Badges Woo also allows the use of emojis on the badges, which increases their attractiveness.

It is a good technique to use the background color of the badge with some color from the image, this will make it harmonious, although you are free to use it as you like.
